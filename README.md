It's just a learning project to get acquainted with Java Spring Boot framework, Lombok and Hibernate ORM using PostgeSQL databases.

It's definitely not a full scaled Java backend, at the moment only required parts are working -- it's main purpose only is to gain some experience with database testing using an H2
in-memory database and to create working REST API endpoints for some advanced Postman API-testing.
